# Versus Game (iOS)

## Overview
This project was developed to reinforce and further sharpen my skills coding with Swift & SwiftUI. It was also created to helped solve a debate between my friends. As huge Marvel Comics fans, we are always discussing who would win in a showdown between The Avengers and The X-Men. This app helps us better visualize and conclude who would win in this hypothetical scenario.

## How It Works


## Future Enhancements

- Add more characters to both teams
- Add logic to incorporate elimination to determine who is most powerful from each team
- Add logic so that whichever team hits X number of points, wins the round

## Technology Used 

- Swift & SwiftUI
- XCode
- Photoshop
