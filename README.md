# Versus Game (iOS)

## Overview
This project was developed to reinforce and further sharpen my skills coding with Swift & SwiftUI. It was also created to helped solve a debate between my friends. As huge Marvel Comics fans, we are always discussing who would win in a showdown between The Avengers and The X-Men. This app helps us better visualize and conclude who would win in this hypothetical scenario.

## How It Works


## Future Enhancements

- Provide guided assistance in reviewing accounts
- Calculate current metrics and provide actionable daily gameplan to help associate hit goals.
- Provide custom timer feature to help associates stay on track.
- Provide frequently calculated dates so time is spent on what matters most.
